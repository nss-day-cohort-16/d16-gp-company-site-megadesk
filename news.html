				<p>The company picnic is going to be held around Percy Priest Lake this coming weekend. Deli sandwichs are being provided, as are soft drinks and water. A fun filled day of games is planned, so prepare for fun! As always, we would like to thank <a href="https://sc.mogicons.com/l/thumbs-up-192.png">Joe Shepard</a> for providing the meals for all the employees.</p>

				<h4>Company Potluck</h4>
				<img src="images/potluck.jpg" alt="Potluck picture" class="sidepic" >
				<p>Last weeks potluck was a huge success! We would especially like to thank Greg for his Gumbo and Brenda for her Jambalay. The entire event will go down in megaDesk history as the second best potluck. The best being of course when Oliver, Steven, Nathan, and LaDonna had a chili cook-off.</p>
