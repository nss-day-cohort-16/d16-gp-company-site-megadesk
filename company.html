				<h4 class="sub-heading">Who We Are</h4>
			<p class="paragraph">We are dreamers. We are doers. And we are ordinary people, just like you: full calendars, busy lives, and Gmail inboxes that we just can't seem to keep clean. megaDesk is America's #4 choice in niche office furniture, specializing in quirky contemporary designs. We are here to give you a new home-away-from-home. "If it's not megaDesk, it's a foot stool".<p>
				<h4 class="sub-heading">What We Do</h4>
			<p class="paragraph">megaDesk is about helping you work harder and smarter - and making you look <strong>doggone good</strong> while you're at it! Let us give you what you really want: a desk that isn't a desk... a desk that's <emphasis>more</emphasis> than a desk - it's a megaDesk.<p>
				<h4 class="sub-heading">How We're Relevant</h4>
			<p class="paragraph">There's nothing worse than a desk that doesn't make a statement. Day in and day out, we hear the voices of customers across the country calling out "Our desks are boring! Our desks are plain!". megaDesk was born to answer that call and to say "No more!". The famine is over. Your megaDesk is here.<p>
